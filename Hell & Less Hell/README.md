# Hell

Ok so these are 2 different maps, but they have the exact same look and layout, with only difference, in hell on the warp island on the top right you can only go counter-clockwise, while in less-hell you can choose which direction you go in.

# Prerequisites
 - Needs to replace a map with cannons, and it works better with dragon quest maps because the warps are differentiated better.

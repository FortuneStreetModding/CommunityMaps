#Description

Ok so these are 2 different maps, but they have the exact same look, and layout,
with only difference, in hell on the warp island on the top right you can only go
counter-clockwise, while in less-hell ypu can chose whihc direction you go in.

#Screenshots
The screenshots show both of the maps, which have the same board layout, so the
screenshot works for both of them. I also included a screenshot with labels of which
warps lead to which, since there are so many.

#Prerequisites
 - Needs to replace a map with cannons, and it works better with dragon quest maps
   because the warps are differentiated better.
